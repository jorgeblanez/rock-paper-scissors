Hello! It's me again.

This is the first step of project Rock, Paper, Scissors. Here I'll create the game on JavaScript and play it using the console.

In the future, we will revisit this code to create a User Interface! Can't wait for it.


Hello again!
It was quite the endeavor. I finally was able to make the UI for this. Finally, i can move on to the other projects

Wakka wakka
